## Description

A JavaScript calculator capable of adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing numbers. The app comes with support for decimal numbers as well as chaining operations one after another. Button sound effects are also available.


## How To Use The Calculator App

To start using the Calculator App, all you have to do is to click on this link <https://peterroman.codes/calculator>.

The calculator in the middle of the screen can be used by clicking on the respective buttons.

| Add Number | Add Decimal Number | Add | Subtract | Multiply | Divide | Get Result |Delete Everything | Toggle Sound Effects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 | . | + | - | x | รท | = | C | โช |

It also allows you to:

* chain operations one after another
    * when you, for example, indicate a number, then an operator, and then another number, the result is stored and you can continue working with it (e.g. select another operator, select another number, etc.)
    * when you press the "=" button to get a result, you can immediately press another operator button to continue working with it
* replace operators with other operations
    * if you, for example, press the "+" button to activate addition, but press the "-" button immediately after to activate subtraction, you will subtract numbers, not add them (the last chosen opertor will apply)
